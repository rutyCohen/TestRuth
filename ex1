1.
We can save time by not calling the same function twice
Like this:
async function myFunc() {
const numberFromServer = await getNumberFromServer();// 3 sec
 let x1 = numberFromServer;
let x2 = numberFromServer ;
return x1 + x2; }
I put the call to another variable because I saw that both variables were defined as let â€“ x1 and x2 , and I understand maybe they 
changed (because they have not been defined as const)
